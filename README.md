# **Legislation Chat**

## Mission Statement:

The gap that weâ€™ve chosen to try and fill is the lack of political and legislative understanding that the average student has. With the recent change in administration, the need to understand the rapidly changing legislation being put out has become an increasingly prevalent issue. The way that we hope to tackle this issue is via an application that scrapes various news sources daily and stores passed legislation as vectorized embeddings in a vector database for Retrieval Augmented Generation  which will be implemented in a chatbot interface. This will allow users to learn more about current legislation through a more natural language interface. The general architecture for a RAG application can be shown below:

 Legislation Chat is a chatbot that provides a way for students to learn about current legislation via a chatbot unlike alternative mediums such as newsletters or subscription based services. Our product allows students to get a tailored experience where they can not only learn the basics of what legislation is being passed, but they can also ask specific follow up questions with regards to things like personal implications.

* For Development *

Go to a directory where you want the project.
```
git clone https://github.com/Soor1/SWE.git
```

Create a new branch based off of dev.
```
git checkout -b new-branch-name dev
```

Create and activate virtual environment.
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate 
#.venv/Scripts/activate for powershell or command prompt
#.venv/Scripts/activate.bat otherwise
```
You should see a little (.venv) tag in your terminal now.


Run the following for installation requirements (this might take a while so be patient)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
