Short title This Act may be cited as the  Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds Congressional Gold Medal Act 2. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) Roderick W. Edmonds (in this Act referred to as  Roddie Edmonds Edmonds (2) Roddie Edmonds was a Master Sergeant in the United States Army and a member of the 422nd Infantry Regiment while serving during World War II. (3) Roddie Edmonds landed in Europe in 1944 and fought to the border between Belgium and Germany. In December of 1944, while fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, Edmonds was captured by Nazi forces and detained in Stalag IX\u2013A, a prisoner of war camp in Ziegenhain, Germany. (4) Stalag IX\u2013A was a site used to identify, segregate, and remove Jewish soldiers from the general population of prisoners of war and many of the Jewish soldiers who were so removed were sent to labor camps or murdered. Members of the Armed Forces were warned of this policy and aware that their fellow servicemen could be at risk. (5) As the senior noncommissioned officer in Stalag IX\u2013A, Master Sergeant Edmonds was responsible for 1,292 members of the Armed Forces at the camp. Approximately 1 month after the date on which Edmonds was detained, Edmonds was directed to order the Jewish-American soldiers under his command to fall out in order to separate the Jewish-American soldiers from their fellow prisoners. (6) Defying the orders of the Nazis, Roddie Edmonds commanded all of his men to fall out and, the following morning, all of the 1,292 members of the Armed Forces under the command of Edmonds stood outside of their prison barracks. (7) Upon seeing the soldiers, a German officer angrily shouted,  They cannot all be Jews! We are all Jews here (8) The German officer took out his pistol and pointed the gun at the head of Edmonds, but Edmonds refused to identify the Jewish soldiers. Instead, Edmonds responded,  According to the Geneva Convention, we only have to give our name, rank, and serial number. If you shoot me, you will have to shoot all of us and, after the war, you will be tried for war crimes (9) The German officer turned away from Edmonds and the other soldiers and left the scene. The actions taken by Edmonds saved the lives of approximately 200 Jewish-American members of the Armed Forces. (10) Lester Tanner, a Jewish-American member of the Armed Forces also captured during the Battle of the Bulge, witnessed the incident and stated that,  There was no question in my mind, or that of Master Sergeant Edmonds, that the Germans were removing the Jewish prisoners from the general population at great risk to their survival. The U.S. Army\u2019s standing command to its ranking officers in POW camps is that you resist the enemy and care for the safety of your men to the greatest extent possible. Master Sergeant Edmonds, at the risk of his immediate death, defied the Germans with the unexpected consequences that the Jewish prisoners were saved (11) Edmonds survived 100 days in captivity and returned home after the war. Later, Edmonds served the United States in Korea as a member of the National Guard. Edmonds died in 1985, but never told his family or anyone else of his brave actions outside the barracks of Stalag IX\u2013A during World War II. (12) Edmonds was posthumously recognized by Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem, as  Righteous Among the Nations Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds seemed like an ordinary American soldier, but he had an extraordinary sense of responsibility and dedication to his fellow human beings. \u2026 The choices and actions of Master Sergeant Edmonds set an example for his fellow American soldiers as they stood united against the barbaric evil of the Nazis (13) 2025 will mark the 80th anniversary of the conclusion of WWII and the atrocities of the Holocaust as well as the 40th anniversary of the passing of Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds. 3. Congressional gold medal (a) Award authorized The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate arrangements for the posthumous award, on behalf of Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design to Roddie Edmonds in recognition of his achievements and heroic actions during World War II. (b) Design and striking For the purpose of the award referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in this Act as the  Secretary (c) Presentation and award of medal The gold medal referred to in subsection (a) shall be presented, and following the presentation awarded, to his son, Pastor Christopher Waring Edmonds, or the next of kin of Roddie Edmonds. 4. Duplicate medals The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck under section 3 under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses. 5.

R. 122 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES January 3, 2025 Mr. Green of Texas Committee on Education and Workforce A BILL To amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to provide for the calculation of the minimum wage based on the Federal supplemental poverty threshold for a renter family of 4, with 2 children under the age of 18, as determined by the Bureau of the Census, and for other purposes. 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the  Original Living American Wage Act Original LAW Act 2. Findings; sense of Congress (a) Findings Congress finds the following: (1) In 2022, there were approximately 37,900,000 Americans living in poverty who were denied access to opportunities due to income, housing, education, jobs, and health care. (2) A full-time worker earning the Federal minimum wage earns an income that is just $20 above the Federal poverty line for a single-person household and $5,360 below the poverty line for a two-person household. (3) The average fair market rent for a 1-bedroom apartment is more than 110 percent of the monthly income of a full-time worker earning the minimum wage. In comparison, the generally accepted definition of affordability is for a household to pay not more than 30 percent of its income on housing. (4) Two full-time workers earning the Federal minimum wage earn an income below the national housing wage, which is the amount a person must earn to afford a 1-bedroom apartment for the average rental price without spending more than 30 percent of their income. (5) In 2023, data from the Living Wage Calculator of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology indicated that the median average living wage across single adults and single adults with one child spanning all 50 States was $26.59 per hour or approximately $48,154.49 annually. (b) Sense of Congress It is the sense of Congress that\u2014 (1) the Federal minimum wage should, at a minimum, be adjusted any time that inflation rises to 5 percent or above over 2 consecutive years so that a wage earner\u2019s annual income will be not less than 40 percent above the Supplemental Poverty Threshold for a renting family of 4, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; (2) the minimum wage should be set at a level high enough to allow 2 full-time minimum wage workers to earn an income above the national housing wage; and (3) Congress, any of the several States, the District of Columbia, any territory or possession of the United States, any Indian tribe, or any local or municipal government of a State may establish a higher minimum wage requirement than that established in this Act. 3. Minimum wage Section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 ( 29 U.S.C. 206 (1) in subsection (a)(1)\u2014 (A) by striking  and (B) by inserting at the end the following: (D) $10.59 an hour, beginning January 1, 2026; (E) $14.59 an hour, beginning January 1, 2027; (F) $18.59 an hour, beginning January 1, 2028; (G) $22.59 an hour, beginning January 1, 2029; (H) $26.59 an hour, beginning January 1, 2030; and (I) the amount determined by the Secretary under subsection (b), beginning January 1, 2031. ; and (2) by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (c) and inserting after subsection (a) the following: (b) (1) Subject to paragraph (3), not later than October 1, 2030, and every 7 years thereafter, the Secretary shall determine the minimum wage rate applicable under subsection (a)(1) based on the formula described in paragraph (2). The Secretary shall publish such wage rate in the Federal Register not later than November 1 of each year in which a minimum wage rate is determined under this paragraph. (2) For the 7-year period beginning on January 1, 2031, and each succeeding 7-year period, the minimum wage rate determined by the Secretary under paragraph (1) shall be a minimum hourly wage sufficient for a person working for such wage for 1,799 hours per year to earn an annual income in an amount that is 40 percent higher than the Federal supplemental poverty threshold for a renter family of 4, with two children under the age of 18, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the year preceding the year in which the wage rate is being so determined. (3) If the minimum wage rate determined by the Secretary under paragraph (1) would result in a lower minimum wage rate than the minimum wage rate in effect at the time of such determination, the Secretary may not adjust the minimum wage rate so in effect. .",

Short title This Act may be cited as the  Rosa Parks Commemorative Coin Act 2. Findings The Congress finds the following: (1) Rosa Parks, widely celebrated as the  Mother of the Civil Rights Movement (2) Born on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, to Leona McCauley, a teacher, and James McCauley, a carpenter, Parks grew up in the segregated South, experiencing firsthand the harsh realities of racial injustice. (3) Despite the profound challenges of racial inequality, Parks attended segregated schools in Alabama, graduating high school in 1933, where her education and experiences fueled her lifelong commitment to activism. (4) In 1943, Parks became deeply involved with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, where she served as Secretary and Youth Leader, investigating cases of racial violence such as the rape of Recy Taylor and the lynching of Emmett Till. (5) On December 1, 1955, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a White man on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama, an act that led to the historic 381-day Montgomery Bus Boycott by more than 40,000 riders. (6) The boycott sparked a legal challenge to Montgomery\u2019s bus segregation laws, which culminated in the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision in Browder v. Gayle declaring bus segregation unconstitutional on November 13, 1956. (7) Following the boycott, Parks faced significant personal and economic hardships, including the loss of her job and ongoing threats to her life, yet her determination to fight for justice remained steadfast. (8) In 1957, Parks moved to Detroit, Michigan, where she continued her work as an advocate for racial equality, focusing on economic justice, political participation, and racial integration. (9) Parks became a global symbol of resistance to racial segregation and injustice, and her act of defiance inspired civil rights movements around the world. (10) Throughout her life, Parks remained committed to civil rights activism, participating in marches and speaking engagements, as well as mentoring younger generations of activists, furthering her legacy of leadership in the struggle for racial equality. (11) Parks passed away on October 24, 2005, at the age of 92, leaving an enduring legacy of courage, resilience, and leadership that continues to inspire social justice and equality advocates across the globe. (12) In recognition of her profound impact, Parks became the first woman and second African American to lie in honor in the United States Capitol Rotunda. (13) In 1996, President Bill Clinton awarded Parks the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor bestowed by the President of the United States. (14) In 1999, Parks received the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions bestowed by the United States Congress. (15) Parks\u2019 legacy is commemorated through numerous schools, streets, transit stations, and monuments named in her honor, ensuring that her contributions to American history are remembered and celebrated. (16) In 2006, Ohio became the first state to designate December 1, the day of Parks\u2019 arrest, as Rosa Parks Day, garnering unanimous support from the state legislature and being signed into law by Governor Bob Taft. (17) Rosa Parks Day is also celebrated in the states of California, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, and New York on her birthday, February 4, and in Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee, and Texas on December 1. (18) It is fitting and proper to recognize and preserve the achievements and impact of Rosa Parks, whose personal sacrifice, unwavering resistance, and inspirational advocacy were essential to the success of the Civil Rights Movement, and whose legacy continues to serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration for future generations. 3.
